### Introduction
X-CASH is a cryptocurrency built on Monero v7 with the aim to become a standard in digital payment and transaction settlement. We believe privacy is very important when it comes to managing personal finances, but at the same time, banks and institutions need to know the source of the funds for KYC purposes. Therefore, we plan on leaving the users the choice of whether or not they want their transaction to be public. 
Because we are implementing a worldwide network of dedicated servers, we hope to make the synchronization of the blockchain faster than other cryptocurrencies as well as reducing transaction latency. We believe this network will be a key component in the deployment of the future improvements we plan on adding to the core code. 


### Fully self-funded

By having funded $100k of the capital, we have decided to not go through an ICO process. We believe this adds another layer of credibility by only asking personal and time commitment from the community.  Finally, the control of 100% of the company’s equity will ensure that no dissension will happen in the decision-making process, enabling faster evolutions and a full realization of the long-term vision we have for the company.

### Regulatory compliant and linked to traditional banking

By being incorporated in France, we want to be compliant with all France and E.U. existing and upcoming regulations. Similarly, thanks to our background in the financial industry, we hope to build a tight link with traditional banking. These two elements are compulsory and needed to bring cryptocurrency to mainstream adoption. Regulations will ensure the protection of the users and investors while banks will serve as a catalyst thanks to their solid base of retail clients.
